# 🔐 Keyloggers and Security in Cybersecurity

This project was developed during a **6-week Cybersecurity Internship** in collaboration with **APSSDC, Edunet Foundation, and IBM SkillsBuild** (May–Jun 2024).  
The project focuses on implementing a **Keylogger** to demonstrate system vulnerabilities and reinforce awareness about **cybersecurity risks** and **defensive practices**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
- Implemented a **Python-based Keylogger** to capture keystrokes securely in a controlled environment.  
- Hands-on experience with **Kali Linux tools** for penetration testing and ethical hacking practices.  
- Analyzed **security vulnerabilities** and explored defense strategies against malicious keyloggers.  
- Gained deeper insights into **ethical hacking concepts, secure coding, and system protection**.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** `pynput`, `os`, `datetime`  
- **Tools:** Kali Linux, Virtual Machine Environment  
- **Concepts:** Cybersecurity Fundamentals, Ethical Hacking, Penetration Testing

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Logs keystrokes in real-time to a hidden file.  
- Timestamps each keystroke entry for analysis.  
- Lightweight script for educational and research purposes.  
- Demonstrates **why securing input devices and system permissions is critical**.
